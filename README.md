# Photo Tagging Web App Game

## Description

This project was created as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
The goal of this project was to combine React with Firebase to create
a Photo Tagging Game, similar to "Where's Waldo". To play the game a user
must select a level on the home screen and find three characters in said level.

The game consists of two main parts, a finder image and a sidebar showing
your time and a character navigation. Selecting a character properly will then cause the
character in the navigation to be marked as found. Toast notifications also appear
after each guess to inform the user of whether or not their guess is correct. Once all of
the characters are found the user is prompted to submit their name and time to the
Firebase database to show in the leaderboards.
